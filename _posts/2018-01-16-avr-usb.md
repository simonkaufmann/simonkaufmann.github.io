It's fascinating to test how much you can get out of a tiny microcontroller,
for example the Atmel [ATmega 16](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/doc2466.pdf), an 8 bit processor clocked at about
16 MHz.

Communicating via USB is a challenge for such a comparably slow and low power
device (with as little as 32kB of storage available for the compiled code). The processor does not come with any hardware USB support and therefore
everything needs to be done in software.

This project is based on [VUSB](https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html), a library implementing low-speed USB 1.1
on the AVR microcontroller and the goal was to implement the [USB Mass Storage protocol](https://www.usb.org/sites/default/files/usbmassbulk_10.pdf)
on the ATmega 16.

As part of the project endpoints, descriptors and communication with the EEPROM
used by the microcontroller to store the actual data was created implementing
the USB Mass Storage protocol.

This protocol requires communication over bulk transfer endpoint which is not
supported for low speed USB and the VUSB library and the microcontroller's specifications
don't allow any faster communication than low speed.

Overcoming the issue was suprisingly simple in the end: the Linux kernel had to 
be recompiled. With the help of a very useful [tool](https://livegrep.com/search/linux)
to search the linux kernel code, I figured out that in fact only one if had
to be removed which blocked bulk transfers on the PC side.

Unfortunately, this means that the USB stick will never be useable on a regular PC,
but of course with only 64kB of EEPROM memory to store files, it wouldn't be particularly
useful anyway. Still I was amazed that it actually proved to work - even on Windows
in a virtual machine with USB support the flash drive was recognised if the VM
runs on a machine with a modified linux kernel.

Code can be found on my [Github](https://github.com/simonkaufmann/AVR-USB-Flash-Drive/).
Additionally, there is also a short [presentation](https://github.com/simonkaufmann/AVR-USB-Flash-Drive/blob/master/doc/avr_usb_flash_drive.pdf) explaining some of the concepts.
