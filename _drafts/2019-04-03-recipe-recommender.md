title: Environmentally Conscious Recipe Recommender

---

As an Edinburgh hackathon project together with friends we created a showcase
within a day to demonstrate how technology can help people reduce their CO2
footprint. Our project helps people to select recipes based on ingredients 
that are local and in season.

The Backend is written in Python using the [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) framework and can be deployed
to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). It provides a web interface and an app
written in [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org) and running cross platform.

During the project I have been responsible for the app development. The code
for the whole project can be found [here](https://github.com/AdrianDoM/HacktheBurghSeasonalRecipes),
the app can be run through the [NativeScript online IDE](https://play.nativescript.org).

Due to the time constraint for the project (24h hour hackathon), it still leaves
options for improvement.
