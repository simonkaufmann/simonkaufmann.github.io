I'm a Computer Science and Maths student in my third year usually studying
at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) in Scotland. At the moment I am on exchange in California
at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/).

In the past I've worked at [several](https://www.aceso.no/) [startups](http://www.list-engineering.at/), creating software and designing electronics. This summer I spent programming for an internship at [Cambridge Consultants](https://www.cambridgeconsultants.com/home), a technical consultancy with focus on medical, industrial and wireless technology.

Whenever possible you'll find me using Linux and C. It works just best for all
the exciting low level stuff. However, these days web stuff got also quite cool
and it's fascinating what you can achieve with an hour of React.

Check out my [Github](https://github.com/simonkaufmann), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/kaufmann-simon) and [resume / CV](/resume.pdf) for things I've built.
